# PoliticallyCorrectVocabulary

In the wake of political issues reaching technical systems it is advisable to create a politically correct vocabulary to use within those systems.
By omitting terms because of their similarity to current non-technical events there is high rist of creating a volatile vocabulary which will add another layer of complexity, risk assesment and liability to writing and maintaining code.
By creating terms of use we can specify the context in which specific terms can be used without violating rules of political correctness.
In case those rules changed we can just update the terms of use on the term itself or the whole collection.
