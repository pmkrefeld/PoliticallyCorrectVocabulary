## Usage in technical context

Excerpt from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master/slave_(technology)).

> Master/slave is a model of asymmetric communication or control where one device or process controls one or more other devices or processes and serves as their communication hub. In some systems a master is selected from a group of eligible devices, with the other devices acting in the role of slaves.[1][2][3] Historically, the master/slave terminology has existed for many decades, and is currently deeply entrenched into the internet, as well as printed books, magazines, manuals, datasheets, and more.

## Origins of the term

Excerpt from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master/slave_(technology)).

> In technology, the use of the word master is sometimes tied to the historically use in arts and craftmanship, where master and grandmaster are positive words that are derived from maestro (from the Italian maestro [maˈestro; maˈɛstro], meaning "master" or "teacher"), and its related uses, such as master craftsman, masterpiece, old master, old master print, for superior skill or work.

The word meister means master in German, which was derived from the Greek word "μήστωρ" (adviser, counselor, adept, scientist),[4] the Latin word "magister" (teacher), the German "meister" from Old High German "meistar",[5] and the Yiddish "mayster".
